<h1>Vital Water: Web Application</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
I am Prem Udeshi, I am a lead devoloper for Vital Water. I am currently 15 years old and I know Arduino, HTML, PHP, MYSQL, and a bit of python along with JavaScript. I love working with IoTs especially one like this one.

This project started off with a personal project at school. Imagine the Personal Project as project showcase, but that project showcase counts for a part of your grade and lasts a whole school year. For the personal project, I needed to connect a project of my choice with some sort of global context. I live in Africa where water is not easily available. On average, people get roughly 7500 Tanzanian Shillings(~3.4 USD) per day in which they need to use it for staying, transport, 3 meals and water. 500mL of bottled water (because not everyone has a water filter at home) costs 500 Shillings (~.3 USD) Which means they will have 7000 Shillings (~3 USD) to do the rest.

Its not that water is expensive but that people want to earn the most money. To tackle this, my project was to generate a vending machine, that "Vends" water. Its an IoT and uses an Web Interface to operate.
